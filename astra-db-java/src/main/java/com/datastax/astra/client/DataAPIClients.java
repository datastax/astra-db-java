/**
 * Provides utility methods for initializing and configuring clients to interact with the Data API. This class
 * simplifies the creation of Data API clients by abstracting the complexities associated with configuring
 * clients for different environments and settings.
 *
 * <p>Depending on the application's requirements and the operational environment, {@code DataAPIClients} can
 * tailor the Data API client with appropriate configuration options such as authentication credentials, connection
 * timeouts, proxy settings, and more. This enables developers to quickly and easily set up their Data API clients
 * without delving into the intricate details of each configuration option.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example Usage:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Get you the client for a local deployment of Data API
 * DataAPIClient devClient = DataAPIClients.local();
 *
 * // Get you the database for a local deployment of Data API
 * DataAPIClient devClient = DataAPIClients.astraDev("token");
 *
 * // Default target environment Astra Production
 * DataAPIClient devClient = DataAPIClients.astra("token");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: This class should be used as a starting point for initializing Data API clients. It is advisable to
 * review the specific configuration options relevant to your use case and adjust them accordingly.</p>
